  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="Images/Alistair Selfie.jpeg" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">
  <form style="margin:auto;width:60%" action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">
    <p>A little about myself. I was born and raised on Norfolk Island which gave me a safe and carefree upbringing. I finished high school in 2006 and moved to Brisbane in 2007. I attended Griffith University straight out of high school however found myself in a degree (Business/Commerce) which I realised didn’t really interest me. I lasted a year and a half before withdrawing from studies to work full time. After spending 10 years in Brisbane I then decided to move to Sydney to where I currently reside. </p>

    <p>I love sport! I follow the NBA, Formula One and the NRL closely. I love shooting hoops in my free time and have been known to put up a wicked air ball! Standing at 5’9 a career in the NBA seems like a longshot. I’m also an avid gamer and travel enthusiast.  By far my favourite and most expensive hobby would be photography. I love being able to explore new places and snap some pics. I enjoy shooting landscapes/urban environments primarily. All photos included in my webpage were taken and edited by me.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>I think I have always had an interest in IT even before realising it. I have always had a fascination for new tech, applications and the improvements it can bring to our lives. I remember using Napster to download my favourite songs and thinking this was the future. I didn’t understand how I was able to seemingly click a button and within a short while (or a lifetime depending on my dialup connection) I’d be listening to my favourite track. It felt like there was no end to what I could do online.</p>

    <p>When I made the decision to study with the hope of changing career, I knew studying both fulltime and in person wouldn’t be an option for me given I’d be juggling a fulltime work schedule and homelife. This led me to Open Universities where I discovered a wide array of IT related sources, a majority of which were through RMIT. After doing some research into RMIT it was clear they were best set up to provide the best learning experience for remote students. In the end it was a no brainer to enrol with RMIT.</p>

    <p>Ultimately studying IT I am expecting to broaden the way I look at the industry and learn some specific skills such as coding and web development. I’m hoping the course with help me think analytically and also provide me with the confidence and know how to operate effectively within a team which is something I think I struggle with at times being Introverted. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/58383667?type=standout#sol=d8159b00b6ed0847fd94121b2ff728d57c218034"><strong>Full Stack Developer</strong></a></p>

      <p>I have chosen the position of a Full Stack Developer as my current ideal Job. My understanding of a Full Stack developer is someone who is proficient in both the front end coding languages for the design and development of a website as well as having the experience of using back end languages to build and maintain a website.
      When I think about what my end goal is whilst studying IT I think of a few things. Firstly I want to be in a position that is quite specialised and requires a lot of experience and skill. I like the idea of having a vast array of knowledge across many programs/languages. I think the position would require a lot of problem-solving constant learning which would keep me engaged in the position. Secondly, I would feel a great sense of satisfaction from creating something from scratch and watching it grow until ultimately I get to see the end product. Being in a position that allows this would give me a great sense of pride in my work</p>

      <p>I am not naïve to the fact to be in a position like this would take many years of learning multiple different languages and systems. I understand its not a position someone will walk into straight out of university. I believe it would take many years of experience within the workplace before being proficient in all aspects of the role. For me to be able to become a full stack dev I’d need to complete my degree in IT. There would be a lot of self learning required outside of formal studies especially when learning different languages such as JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS. This is to help hone my abilities when using these languages.
      Whilst I have no formal education around IT or web development I have grown up with computers and as such feel I will be able to pick up learning the skills necessary to achieve my career goals. People who haven’t used computers their whole lives may be at a disadvantage in this regard.</p>

      <p>I have done some research into what it may take to become a full stack dev and from what I can see the consensus is to focus on front end development first and become proficient in the front end languages before looking at extending my learning to the back end. I think post university this is what I will focus on first prior to seeking experience more on the backend side. </p>

  <h6>The Big Five Personality Test (Figure 4)</h6>

      <p>Upon completing the above tests I have found it has given me a great insight into my personality and personality traits both good and bad. It also helps me get an idea of how I best learn and take on information. Having an understanding of this helps me identify what I may need to work on to succeed not only during my studies but also in the workplace. It also helps me identify my strengths and what I may be able to offer whilst working in a team environment. </p>

      <p>Its pretty clear looking at my results I am an introverted person something which has hindered progress in my professional life in the past. The 16 personalities test has highlighted my flexible and adaptable approach to life which is something I have never realised about myself but completely agree with. I am not used to planning things out and putting together schedules which is something I have had to prioritise since starting my studies.
      My lack of organisational structure at times also leads me to worry about letting others down. On the other side of the spectrum however I am very approachable and easy going so working with all types of personalities doesn’t bother me. I’m certainly not the type of personality to find myself clashing with someone else. </p>

      <p>Using the information I have learnt about myself I think I would definitely benefit from grouping up with someone who is more of a natural leader. I think my personality allows me to get along with most people and not need to be in the spot light to be effective. Having said that my introversion may be a hurdle if I’m required to be the one in charge. I would work well when knowing exactly what I am required to do and knowing everyone is on the same page. I am naturally an independent worker so I think of my strengths would be completing tasks without the need for assistance or constant reassurance.
      I also think I would bring creativity and ideas to a group project which would work well with someone more logical minded</p>

    </header>
<h2>Project Idea</h2>

        <p>In short the idea I had for my project is an all in one motor claims lodgement mobile application. This idea has come to me from my experience working with my current employer (GT Insurance) who is a commercial fleet motor insurer. The application will enable customers to lodge an insurance claim on the spot at the scene of the accident. Having an application guiding a driver through what is needed from the scene of the accident (example: images of the accident, other vehicles registration plate, other party’s drivers license information) will assist the customer having an efficient claims process without unnecessary delays.</p>

   <h4>Motivation</h4>

        <p>One of the biggest drawbacks with my company is the delay it takes for a customer/broker to lodge a claim via email which then gets allocated to a lodgement consultant tasked to then lodge the claim on GT’s internal claims software. Dependant on the backlog of new claims it sometimes can take up to a few business days for our customers to receive a new claim acknowledgement with a claim number. Having the availability for a company to provide its drivers with a claim lodgement app will greatly streamline the claims process providing the clients with an immediate claim reference they can use to provide to a repairer to begin the quote/assessment process</p>

   <h4>Features</h4>

        <p>The app would be used in conjunction with my company’s current claims software ensuring both the app and claims software can provide one another information. The user will create an account using their policy details and once created will have access to information about what policy they have, their insured vehicle information and the contact information for the specific claims consultant assigned to their policy. This would create a greater sense of personalised service rather than the stereotypical call centre/ long hold time most Insurers provide.</p>

        <p>The app would be utilised at the scene of an accident allowing the user to obtain all the information they need to lodge a claim then and there. The app would access the users camera phone allowing for photos of the accident to be taken and included in the lodgement. The app would also prompt the user of what images are specifically required such as photos of the other cars registration plate, complete shot of accident, photo including any road markings or road signs ect. to avoid redundant images being taken.</p>

        <p>A majority of the time when a driver is involved in an accident it is most likely the first accident they have been involved in and as such may not have a specific repairer they have used in the past. The app would utilise google maps by giving the user the option to search smash repairers or tow companies in the area to allow the customer to source a repair quotation at their earliest convenience. Example below:</p>

        <div class="w3-row">
          <div class="w3-half">
            <img src="Images/Google Search Image.png" style="width:200%" height="400px">
          </div>
        </div>


          <h6>(Figure 5)</h6>

          <p>Once a quote has been obtained the user can take a photo through the app of the quote and upload it straight to the insurance company to then organise an assessment. Whilst doing so the app would prompt the user which assessing firms the insurance company is affiliated with giving the user choice of which assessor they’d prefer to use for their assessment. This is particularly beneficial for clients with a fleet of vehicle who have built up a working relationship with a particular assessor.  Allowing them to ensure their preferred assessor gets the job rather than leaving it up to the Insurer to appoint someone at random. </p>

          <p>I would also include the use of data provided by the Bureau of Meteorology to provide pop up alerts to customers notifying them of any imminent hail or severe weather warning. This feature would be beneficial to companies who have a fleet of vehicles on the roads assisting to minimise their risk.
          The app would also utilise a pay function allowing for policy premium or excess payments to be processed without the need to log onto a computer.</p>

  <h4>Tools & Technologies</h4>

          <p>I would need software that could operate my app on all mobile platforms to ensure the app doesn’t excluded members of our customer base. When looking at the app running on an Apple device the main programming language used is Swift. This language was specifically created by Apple. Alternatively looking into Android devices according to an article found on the Geeksforgeeks (figure 6) website there are several languages to choose from such as Java, Kotlin, C++, Python, Dart ect.</p>

  <h4>Skills Required</h4>

          <p>To get the app running I could possibly look into subscribing to an app building platform. Upon researching this some services allow it so you can get an app built by selecting pre-made templates and making cosmetic changes to it depending on your preference and requirements. Typically, these platforms charge you a monthly fee to keep your app running.</p>

          <p>However given the specific needs and functions the proposed app is supposed to provide it will most likely need to be built from scratch. This would most likely be done by hiring the services of a company specialising in the development, testing and maintenance of apps or a developer capable of doing this. There are a lot of companies centred around app development however utilising this option may be costly. </p>

  <h4>Outcome</h4>

          <p>I genuinely think if this app were to be developed it would fast track the claims lodgement process for our customers. Not only the lodgement process but with features such as repairer recommendation, mobile payment, direct consultant contact information it would speed up the claims process, leading to increased customer satisfaction and company reputation. This app is something that could be continually worked on also to keep up with business changes and needs ensuring its long-term effectiveness. With the increase in motor vehicle technology and in car applications I can see this app making it into customers vehicles as a risk management tool for companies with a fleet of vehicles. </p>
